# phase-1-week-1-code-challenge

* All the challenges were solved using JavaScript.
* A user interface has been created to test all the challenges.
* Each challenge has its own file where the main functions have been exported and compiled in one file - `index.js`.
* All challenges work well. The functions were structured in a way to minimize bugs as much as possible.
* Parcel dependency was used for build
* A nav-bar has been created to navigate to specific challenges
* The project has been hosted in `vercel`.

### Challege-1 Student Grade generator

* One main function was created to solve the challenge
* `if else statement` was used to check for various conditions
* A range of `0 - 100` was set at the begining of the function to avoid grading invalid scores

### Challenge-2 Speed Detector

* One main function was created to solve the challenge
* `if else statement` was used to check for various conditions
* A speed range of upto `400km/hr` was set to avoid unrealistic speed

### Challenge-3 Net Salary Calculator

* The function had several conditions to check. Therefore, a couple of helper functions were created.
* `if else statement` was used to check for various conditions
* Minimum deductable income for `NHIF` is set to `ksh. 1000`
* The `NSSF` deduction calculation assumes a rate of `6%` through out
* Minimum deductable income for `NSSF` is set to `ksh. 3000`
* The `payee` calculation incorporated `pension relief` and checked for conditions to match as much as possible to the internet sources
* A main Function `netSalaryCalculator` was created to merge all the functions


### Challenges faced

* Time was a challenge. However, This has come as a lesson to plan well
* Refactoring code was also a challenge. There is a lot of code repeatition. I hope to improve on that in future
