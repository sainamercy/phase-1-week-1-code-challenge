# Brief Challenge Description

* All the challenges were solved using JavaScript.
* A user interface has been created to test all the challenges.
* Each challenge has its own file where the main functions have been exported and compiled in one file - `index.js`.

### Challege-1 Student Grade generator

* One main function was created to solve the challenge
* `if else statement` was used to check for various conditions
* A range of `0 - 100` was set at the begining of the function to avoid grading invalid scores

### Challenge-2 Speed Detector

* One main function was created to solve the challenge
* `if else statement` was used to check for various conditions
* A speed range of upto `400km/hr` was set to avoid unrealistic speed

### Challenge-3 Net Salary Calculator

* `if else statement` was used to check for various conditions
* Minimum deductable income for `NHIF` is set to `ksh. 1000`
* The `NSSF` deduction calculation assumes a rate of `6%` through out
* Minimum deductable income for `NSSF` is set to `ksh. 3000`
